# PyAutoGui Rickroll

## Why?

Yes

## Will it work everywhere?

No. I made this script with my machine in mind. Different browsers may have different shortcuts and the way the browser
is opened is very specific for my setup.

The script can still be used with some light modification, mostly just changing strings in the code.

## Dependencies

If you are on Linux (like me) you have to install python3-tkinter (names change depending on distro and/or package manager).
